The stone tools mod is a mod that adds in a new tier of tools, stone tools. They can be crafted in the same way as other tools, however bars are replaced with stone blocks in the recipe. 

Changelog:

- Added in a new fishing rod, the stone fishing rod. The fishing rod's stats are between a wooden fishing rod and a reinforced fishing rod.
- Changed the description

Items added in this mod:
- Stone Sword
- Stone Pickaxe
- Stone Axe
- Stone Hammer
- Stone Hamaxe (This will allow you to get a hamaxe very early in game)
- Stone Bow
- Stone Fishing Rod (NEW)

This mod is rather simple, but I think it can be helpful. It allows you to get a fast upgrade from the starting copper tools, which can help speed up early pre-hardmode.
This is also my first mod I have made, so I hope you enjoy it! <3
