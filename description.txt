The stone tools mod is a mod that adds in a new tier of tools, stone tools. They can be crafted in the same way as other tools, however ingots are replaced with stone blocks in the recipe. 

Items added in this mod:
Stone Sword
Stone Pickaxe
Stone Axe
Stone Hammer
Stone Hamaxe (This will allow you to get a hamaxe very early in game)
Stone Bow

This mod is rather simple, but I think it can be helpful. It allows you to get a fast upgrade from the starting copper tools, which can help speed up early pre-hardmode.
This is also my first mod I have made, so I hope you enjoy it! <3
