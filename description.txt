The stone tools mod is a mod that adds in a new tier of tools, stone tools. They can be crafted in the same way as other tools, however bars are replaced with stone blocks in the recipe. 

Changelog:

- Added in a ebonstone variant for each tool, except the hamaxe and fishing rod.
- Added in a crimstone variant for each tool, except the hamaxe and fishing rod.
- Added in a pet rock block, it is just a fun prop for your homes/builds. It is crafted with one stone block and one fallen star.
- Very minor tweaks

Items added in this mod:
- Stone Sword (With ebonstone and crimstone variants)
- Stone Pickaxe (With ebonstone and crimstone variants)
- Stone Axe (With ebonstone and crimstone variants)
- Stone Hammer (With ebonstone and crimstone variants)
- Stone Hamaxe
- Stone Bow (With ebonstone and crimstone variants)
- Stone Fishing Rod
- Pet Rock

This mod is rather simple, but I think it can be helpful. It allows you to get a fast upgrade from the starting copper tools, which can help speed up early pre-hardmode.
This is also my first mod I have made, so I hope you enjoy it! <3
